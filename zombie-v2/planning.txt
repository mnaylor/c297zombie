Strategies:
	  
Home base will be set up for normals.  On start-up, home base will be
determined by whichever corner has the lowest zombie to normal ratio.

//Idea: Find smallest normal.  Defenders will protect this normal at
the cost of all other normals.  Strategy when my normals are pit
against classmate's zombies.  Can't lose!!

// What to do with happiness levels?

Normals:
 - cluster near defensive defenders/home base
    
    Behaviour on zombie alert: send the nearest normal out as bait,
        while all other normals retreat to base.  Push nearest normal
        out??

    Non-interactive behaviour:

Defenders:
    - split into two groups, offensive, defensive
    - grouping determined by proximity to home base on start-up
    - offensive defenders move to takeout nearest zombie
    - defensive defenders protects the cluster of normals/home base

    Non-interactive behaviour:
    - can turn zombie colour (practicality? maybe a different but similar
    green?) to stop zombies from running away

    Teleport: Opposite corner of home base

Zombies:
    - Run away from defenders
    - Run towards normals

    Non-interactive behaviour:
    - a formation is made which will attract normals
    - what triggers formation?
