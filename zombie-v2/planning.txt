Strategy: 
A "select" normal will be chosen, which will be defended
at the cost of all other normal agents.  Three "select" defenders will
be chosen to defend the select normal.  If there are fewer than three
defenders, the select normal will run to the homebase corner, and will
be defended by the defenders that are available.

Once the select team has been formed, the triangle will move around
the playroom hunting down zombies.

All normals, other than the select normal, will cluster around a
homebase corner.  If there are more than three defenders, the extra
defenders will protect the homebase.

A zombie alert will be called by the defenders when a zombie
approaches the homebase.  Upon a zombie alert, the normals will send a
sacrificial lamb out to bait the zombies away from homebase.

Defenders will teleport zombies to the farthest corner from the
homebase.

Zombies will mindlessly chase the normals - they will chase the normal
that is nearest.  If there is a critical mass of zombies (say, greater
than ten), the zombies will form a diagonal line and move across the
screen, attacking all normals in their path.
